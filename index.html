                <h3>Geospatial Data Scientist</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a senior at the University of Washington studying Geospatial Data Science. I have experience in analyzing
                    and visualizing spatial data using various GIS software and web-based development libraries, data-driven programming
                    using python and R including various packages within them, and translating my projects to understandable project
                    deliverables where useful insights can be extracted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm intersted in machine learning, remote sensing, and data science in econometrics. The intersection between creating
                    predictive models using remote sensing data for earth observation is an intriguing field to me and I'd like to explore
                    careers between the two. I also find that there are many disciplines within econometrics that you can apply advanced
                    data science techniques to, such as time-series forecasting sales figures, predictive risk assessment, and predicting
                    price elasticities for a product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy exploring and applying different data science principles across various fields. In Fall of 2023 I took
                    a data science in pricing course that taught predicting optimal prices and price elasticities in a large dataset
                    of product prices across different stores in different weeks using R and machine learning packages within R. After
                    taking this course I was inspired to think of the different fields I could apply the data science and analysis
                    principles I've learned to, not limited to a geospatial field.
